        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            receiver_user_id (``int`` | ``str``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the user who received the message.

            ephemeral_message_id (``int``):

            parse_mode (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ParseMode`, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.

            caption_entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`):
                List of special entities that appear in the caption, which can be specified instead of *parse_mode*.

                An InlineKeyboardMarkup object.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message`: On success, the edited message is returned.
